# Reinforcement Learning

This domain of Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating and challenging field. I had the privilege to study Reinforcement learning and learn algorithms
through mutiple projects. All the above projects have been created using my learnings throughout the course. 

## 1. Spaceship rental problem

This project uses basic value iteration and policy iteration to help agent find optimal solution. The objective of problem is to help spaceship rental
manager to find right fit for renting and moving spaceships from one station to another efficiently.

Concepts used:
- Markov Decision Process
- Value Iteration
- Policy Evaluation
- Action Selection Methods

## 2. Maze Problem

Maze problem has been solved using Semi-Gradient SARSA algorithm. This is an advanced algorithm used mostly for a model free problems. As maze grid can have numerous states to 
calculate action value, we cannot use out traditional transition probability matrix calculation to solve our value functions. 

Concepts used:
- Markov Decision Process
- Approximation of Policy technique
- On Policy Control: Semi-Gradient SARSA 
- Gym Environment for implementation

## 3. Sokoban Game

This was my final project for Reinforcement Learning course. It is a crude implementation of exact Sokoban Game. There are two algorithms used
to final optimal policy for the agent. As this problem comes uder computationally PSPACE-HARD problem, it is not possible to fully solve this. 

Concepts used:
- Markov Decision Process
- Temporal Difference Learning Algorithm (TD Learning)
- TD(0): SARSA
- Gym Environment
